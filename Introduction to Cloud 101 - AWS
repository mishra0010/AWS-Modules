## 💡 What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is the on-demand delivery of computing resources over the internet with a pay-as-you-go model. It eliminates the need for owning physical infrastructure and enables organizations to scale resources as needed.

### ✨ Key Benefits

- 💸 **Cost Efficiency** – Pay only for what you use
- 📈 **Scalability** – Instantly scale up or down
- 🌍 **Global Access** – Reach users worldwide
- 🔐 **Security** – Built-in security at every layer
- ⚙️ **Automation** – Automate infrastructure management

---

## 🧱 Cloud Models

### 🔹 Service Models

| Model | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **IaaS** | Infrastructure as a Service | EC2 (Virtual servers) |
| **PaaS** | Platform as a Service | AWS Elastic Beanstalk |
| **SaaS** | Software as a Service | Gmail, Salesforce |

### 🔹 Deployment Models

- 🟦 **Public Cloud** – Shared infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure)
- 🟩 **Private Cloud** – Dedicated infrastructure for one org
- 🟨 **Hybrid Cloud** – Mix of public + private cloud

---

## 🌍 AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS's infrastructure is designed for **availability**, **redundancy**, and **low-latency performance**:

- 🌐 **Regions** – Geographical locations (e.g., us-east-1)
- 🏢 **Availability Zones (AZs)** – Isolated data centers within a region
- 📦 **Edge Locations** – For caching content closer to users (used by Amazon CloudFront)

---

## 🛡️ AWS Shared Responsibility Model

AWS and customers **share responsibility** for security:

| Responsibility | AWS | Customer |
|----------------|-----|----------|
| Physical Security | ✅ | ❌ |
| Network Infrastructure | ✅ | ❌ |
| Operating System | ❌ | ✅ |
| IAM & Data Encryption | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🧱 AWS Well-Architected Framework

A set of best practices for building secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient cloud infrastructure.

### 🏗️ Five Pillars

1. ⚙️ **Operational Excellence**
2. 🔐 **Security**
3. 🔁 **Reliability**
4. 🚀 **Performance Efficiency**
5. 💰 **Cost Optimization**

## 🚀 AWS Core Services Covered

### 🖥️ **Amazon EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Launch and manage virtual servers for running applications and services in the cloud.

> ✅ Ideal for hosting websites, apps, or running background jobs.

---

### 🗂️ **Amazon S3** (Simple Storage Service)
Object-based storage service with high durability and scalability. Store files, backups, images, and more.

> ✅ Think of it as a super-reliable cloud USB drive.

---

### 🧮 **Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service)
Managed database service that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

> ✅ Handles backups, patching, and scaling — so you don’t have to.

---

### 🌐 **Amazon VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)
Your private, customizable network inside AWS with subnets, routing tables, and gateways.

> ✅ Gives you complete control over how your resources connect.

---

### 🛡️ **IAM** (Identity and Access Management)
Securely manage users, groups, and permissions for AWS resources.

> ✅ Grant least-privilege access with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

---

### ⚙️ **AWS Lambda**
Run your code in response to events — without provisioning or managing servers. Perfect for automation and microservices.

> ✅ Pay only for the compute time you use.

---

### 📊 **Amazon CloudWatch**
Monitor your AWS resources and applications in real-time. Collect logs, set alarms, and trigger automated actions.

> ✅ Essential for operational visibility and troubleshooting.

---

## 🧪 Lab Environment

Throughout this course, you’ll interact with AWS through hands-on labs using:

- ✅ EC2 (Launch a virtual server)
- ✅ S3 (Create and manage a bucket)
- ✅ IAM (Add users and roles)
- ✅ RDS (Launch a database)
- ✅ VPC (Build a basic network)
- ✅ Lambda (Run event-driven functions)
- ✅ CloudWatch (Set up monitoring)

---

## 🧭 Entry-Level Career Paths

Here are four common entry-level roles in cloud computing:

1. 👨‍💻 **Cloud Support Associate**  
   Helps customers troubleshoot and operate AWS services.

2. 🔧 **Junior Cloud/DevOps Engineer**  
   Works with CI/CD, automation, and infrastructure provisioning tools.

3. 🧠 **Solutions Architect (Associate Level)**  
   Designs basic cloud architectures for clients or teams.

4. 📞 **Cloud Sales/Technical Account Manager**  
   Bridges the gap between technical solutions and customer needs.
